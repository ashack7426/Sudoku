This is my Sudoku backtracking visualizer. This program allows one to play a game of Sudoku and/or view a backtracking solver. 
This program lets you pencil in possible numbers in each cell and can generate any n x n sudoku given enough time. 
Three wrong gueses for a cell and the Sudoku board solves itself. 

# How to Use

arrow keys/mouse clicks - move the cursor

r - reset to new board

i - input a custom board

space - solve the sudoku

del/backspace - clear pencil marks in cursor cell

enter - check to see if latest pencil in cursor cell is correct

number keys - pencil possible numbers in the cursor cell
